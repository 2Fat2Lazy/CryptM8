# CryptM8
An open-source Python encryption suite.

This is my first proper programming project and also my first foray into Python programming so when using the program it is safe to assume I 'DO NOT' know what I am doing and as such there is probably many places where I could improve both security & readability/conciseness of the code however for a first project in a new programming language I am quite proud of CryptM8 and have shared this project on Github to both give it a permanent home but also so people can freely modify/update and maintain the code as they see fit.

# Features
Full Encryption/Decryption suite using SHA3/AES cryptography (Supports single files, folders and even full drive encryption/decryption)
Password protection of program (poor implementation)
Ability to hide files within images using Steg module
Limited File Browser capability(Browse,Copy,Delete)
Limited TCP/IP file sending/receiving capability
And even an un-finished feature hidden within the menus (Its pretty bad, don't get your hopes up)

# REQUIREMENTS
cryptography, colorama, progress, pywin32, steg

# Credits
Original Code/Design - J. Street
